# Anagram finder

Module finds "shifted anagrams" (where letters maintain order but are shifted by number of positions) among given words.

> Note: for regular anagrams (i.e. if the letters order can be ignored) a more performant solution can be used (with less code). See branch `regular-anagram`

## Usage
